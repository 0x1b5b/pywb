pywb 0.2.2 changelist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Generate cdx indexs via command-line `cdx-indexer` script. Optionally sorting, and output to either a single combined file or a file per-directory.
  Refer to ``cdx-indexer -h`` for more info.
  
* Initial support for prefix url queries, eg: http://localhost:8080/pywb/\*/http://example.com\* to query all captures from http://example.com

* Support for optional LXML html-based parser for fastest possible parsing. If lxml is installed on the system and via ``pip install lxml``, lxml parser is enabled by default.
  (This can be turned off by setting ``use_lxml_parser: false`` in the config)

* Full support for `Memento Protocol RFC7089 <http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/>`_ Memento, TimeGate and TimeMaps. Memento: TimeMaps in ``application/link-format`` provided via the ``/timemap/*/`` query.. eg: http://localhost:8080/pywb/timemap/\*/http://example.com
  
* pywb now features new `domain-specific rules <https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb/blob/master/pywb/rules.yaml>`_ which are applied to resolve and render certain difficult and dynamic content, in order to make accurate web replay work.
  This ruleset will be under further iteration to address further challenges as the web evoles.
